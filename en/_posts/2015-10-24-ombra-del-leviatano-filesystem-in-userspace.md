I offer a brief historical introduction as well as a technical overview of FUSE, an ingenious combination of a userspace interface and kernel code that allows us to implement, effortlessly, a filesystem in userspace. The reference implementation is fully FOSS, being covered by GPL for the kernel part, and by LGPL for the C library.

From a computer-theoretical point of view, through FUSE the Linux kernel draw closer to more “academic”, microkernel-based operating systems, like the Hurd.

A minimal but functional implementation of a toy filesystem is proposed as a working example.
