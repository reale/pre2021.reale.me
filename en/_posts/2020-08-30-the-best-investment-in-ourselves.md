Let this not be taken as an inclination to enroll him in my private Pantheon, but I hereby declare that I would pay to boast in my late thirties as little as one tenth of Warren Buffettâ€™s stamina today. And he just turned ninety.

In a moment of global uncertainty, none of his advice do I find at the same time more daring and more worthwhile that his encouragement to always invest in ourselves. Investing is always less reassuring than letting our own assets sleep (be it in our pocket or in our brain), but it is also the only way to keep oneself, and the world, ticking.
