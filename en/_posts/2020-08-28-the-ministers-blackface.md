Behind this outrageous inability to understand why a blackface is a huge no-no, there lies that very same self-deceptive narrative which depicts Italians as *brava gente* (decent people) and has proven useful in dismissing as hullabaloo the Italian fascist genocide in Ethiopia, exactly as it continues to prove an ace up Italy's sleeve when international criticism over *caporalato* (illegal recruitment of migrants bordering on slavery) and systemic racism has to be dodged away.

I am never too happy to admit that Italian politics really has a knack for rancid provincialism and an even worse absolute lack of understanding of the Zeitgeist.
