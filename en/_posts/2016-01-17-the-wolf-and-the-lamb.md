Traduzione da Fedro / Translation from Phaedrus

<p><em>Ad rivum eundem lupus et agnus venerant,<br />
siti compulsi. Superior stabat lupus,<br />
longeque inferior agnus. Tunc fauce improba<br />
latro incitatus iurgii causam intulit;<br />
'Cur' inquit 'turbulentam fecisti mihi<br />
aquam bibenti?' Laniger contra timens<br />
'Qui possum, quaeso, facere quod quereris, lupe?<br />
A te decurrit ad meos haustus liquor'.<br />
Repulsus ille veritatis viribus<br />
'Ante hos sex menses male' ait 'dixisti mihi'.<br />
Respondit agnus 'Equidem natus non eram'.<br />
'Pater hercle tuus' ille inquit 'male dixit mihi';<br />
atque ita correptum lacerat iniusta nece.<br />
Haec propter illos scripta est homines fabula<br />
qui fictis causis innocentes opprimunt.</em></p>

<p>A Wolf and a Lamb, who longed to slake their thirst, happened to came to one brooklet. Upstream did the Wolf take his stance, and further down the Lamb rested.</p>

<p>Quoth the Wolf: «Wherefore art thou muddling the water to my drinking?» For a mischievous hunger preyed upon him, and therefore he sought pretences of feud.</p>

<p>The Lamb faltered: «How could I, pray, be guilty of such a thing as the one with which thou reproachest me, O Wolf? For the water floweth to me after passing there, where thou art.»</p>

<p>Then the Wolf, who could not deny the truth, rejoined: «Not so much as six months have passed away, since thou spokest ill of me.» And: «To be sure—the Lamb endeavoured to defend himself—I had not even been born.» «Thy father then, by Jove, spoketh ill of me.»</p>

<p>And by and by the Wolf caught hold of the Lamb, and slew him with wicked hand.</p>

<p>This fable is written for those who oppress the innocent by means of Janus-faced reasons.</p>
