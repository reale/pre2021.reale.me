eNEIDE â€“ eNotification and ESPD Integration for Developing Eprocurement (action no. 2018-IT-IA-0170) is a national project funded by the European Commission through the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) programme, in which AgID participates as coordinator of a consortium of institutions and private partners consisting of the National Anti-Corruption Authority (ANAC), Intercent-ER Regional Agency for the Development of Telematic Markets (INTERCENT-ER), Tuscany Region (RT), Regional Company for Innovation and Purchasing (ARIA SpA ) and LUISS Guido Carli University (LUISS).

The project has the overall goal of evolving the national eProcurement architecture through a twofold action:

* the evolution of the Italian contract register National Database of Public Contracts (BDNCP);
* the adoption of the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) based on the Exchange Data Model (EDM), version 2 self-contained, for the regional purchasing platforms of ARIA (Lombardy Region), Tuscany Region, Intercent-ER (Region Emilia-Romagna), including the adoption of eNotification through the integration of BDNCP with the Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) platform.

The project is connected to the results obtained through the CEF projects already concluded in the eProcurement area (2015-IT-IA-0108 and 2016-IT-IA-0038), while maintaining a strong link with the national and European agenda for the eProcurement.

The project aims at building an ICT architecture designed to be modular and compliant with EU regulations and best practices, in order to ensure wide cross-border interoperability. As regards the evolution of BDNCP, the integration with the European TED platform will allow the national infrastructure to complete automatically the ePublication process at the end of the pre-award phase.
