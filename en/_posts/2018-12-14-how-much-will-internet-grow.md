How much will Internet grow in the next years? Which changes will the IP traffic undergo?

The last update of the [Cisco Visual Networking Index Forecast for 2017--2022](https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&articleId=1955935) is out. A few astounding numbers:

-   The annual global IP traffic will reach 4.8 ZB per year by 2022, or 396 exabytes (EB) per month (which is roughly the amount of data that crossed the Internet in 2012)
-   Global IP traffic will increase threefold over the next 5 years
-   The number of devices connected to IP networks will be more than three times the global population by 2022 (IoT, are you there?)
