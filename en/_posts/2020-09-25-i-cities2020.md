As [Eutopian](https://eutopian.eu) I will be delivering a presentation with Roberta Centonze ([agrathaer](http://www.agrathaer.de/)) at the [6th Italian Conference on ICT for Smart Cities and Communities](http://icities2020.unisa.it/) on *Digital identity towards democratic management of public goods*, and more specifically on Self-Sovereing Identity as an enabler for citizen involvement in policymaking.
