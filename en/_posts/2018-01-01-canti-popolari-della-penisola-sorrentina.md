_Canti popolari della Penisola Sorrentina_ to recover and digitize significant documents for the history of popular poetry in the Sorrento Peninsula.

The author then added a work of "translation" into Italian to the digitization work, with a twofold purpose: on the one hand, to make these texts attractive to a wider audience; on the other, to dedicate oneself to a personal exercise to deepen the language, style and culture of which the Songs are an expression.

The cover book is by Francesco Saverio Gargiulo.
