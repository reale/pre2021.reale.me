Nobody, I am sure, can be so absent-minded as to believe that there is no urgency to plan the aftermath, to trace the road back to (some form of) business as usual, for when we will be able to get a glimspe of light at the end of the tunnel. A road which will be quite a steep one, and which will put the weakest among us at the risk of not making it.

Yet today in Italy (or, for that matter, throughout Europe and the greatest part of the world) nobody should even think of going to such length as to announce dates completely out of the blue, whether they are assumed to be ere or after Easter, in April or in May. Not the least reason is that we are not going to see any light at the end of the tunnel anytime soon.

What we should focus on is, on the other hand, a "path to normality" which cannot be tied to single dates set forth ex cathedra, but which should be parameterised on very specific indicators, endowed with enough flexibility to manage the (very likely) fluctuations in the figures of the infection which will be part of the "new normal".

This is a (political, economical, and scientific) debate which is well worth engaging in, while keeping in mind that the strategy, this time, is either a shared one or does not exist at all.
