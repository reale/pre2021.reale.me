The Fast It project (formerly Se.C.O.Li, Servizi consolari on line) is an e-government project by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Italy.

The project aimed at filling in the gap between web-oriented, G2C services (such as the Se.C.O.Li platform) and the Ministry's private infrastructure for consular assistance (SIFC).

In particular, we undertook the design and implementation of a generalized message-oriented middleware infrastructure, based on the JBoss HornetQ asynchronous queue manager on one side of the bridging and Oracle Advanced Queuing on the other side, with inbetwixt the Mule Enterprise Service Bus acting as a “smart channel” for XML fragments moving back and forth.
