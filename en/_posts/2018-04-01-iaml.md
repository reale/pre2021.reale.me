Machine learning is a key technology that powers most of today's advancements in artificial intelligence and data science. Our aim as the Italian Association for Machine Learning (IAML) is to foster the development of ML in all sectors of the public life, by organizing, promoting, and sponsoring technical conferences, events, Meetups, and other initiatives throughout Italy.
