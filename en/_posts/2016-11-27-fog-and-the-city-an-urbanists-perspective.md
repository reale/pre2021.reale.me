The new models for an open, distributed, collaborative computing not only do offer huge opportunities both in technological and in operational terms: they are also capable of fostering a widespread participation of civic awareness. The basic theme of the talk, offered at the Ninux Day 2016 in Florence, encourages a vision of computing and connection as common goods, hence as values subtracted to a centralized control and entrusted to a collective management.
