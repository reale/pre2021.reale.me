Failure in understanding that public digital services' inclusiveness is an absolute priority is a huge telltale mark.

Contact tracing must be non-discriminatory in every aspect, as stressed multiple times by EU-level policymakers (not earlier than two days ago by the [European Parliament](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20200512IPR78915/covid-19-tracing-apps-meps-stress-the-need-to-preserve-citizens-privacy)), and this includes a number of topics such as accessibility ([#8](https://github.com/immuni-app/documentation/issues/8)), multilingual support ([#13](https://github.com/immuni-app/documentation/issues/13)), privacy by design even in the documentation ([#16](https://github.com/immuni-app/documentation/issues/16)), using a gender-neutral language ([#22](https://github.com/immuni-app/documentation/issues/22)), and avoiding ableisms.

I will go to such lengths as to claim that a failure in delivering a thoroughly inclusive digital or service is tantamount to a failure of the whole project, as it would pave the way for a less fair society. And that is true regardless of whether the service were elsewise successful in fighting the pandemics or not.

Come on: inclusiveness is no unattainable goal even with such hectic time constraints as we all are facing. A good starting point are Google's [guidelines on writing inclusive documentation](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation).
