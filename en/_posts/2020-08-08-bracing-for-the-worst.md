> «June 2021. The world has been in pandemic mode for a year and a half. The virus continues to spread at a slow burn; intermittent lockdowns are the new normal. An approved vaccine offers six months of protection, but international deal-making has slowed its distribution. An estimated 250 million people have been infected worldwide, and 1.75 million are dead.»

This worst-case scenario, says [*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02278-5), could actually play out starting from the next autumn, notwithstanding the fact that not only your typical sheeple across the beach umbrella but also world-class leaders are still hoping to muddle through by playing dumb.

It is crucial that every available means be put to good use in order to control the spread of the contagion, including exposure notification through digital services (be it Italian [*Immuni*](https://www.immuni.italia.it/) or the forthcoming Belgian [*Coronalert*](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/sites/corona-app/)). The latter could indeed prove a pillar of the "new normal", for all we know: in that case, a European joint governance effort is unavoidable.
