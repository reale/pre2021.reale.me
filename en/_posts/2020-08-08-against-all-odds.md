This picture is tell-tale.

For it tells us so much about that inextricable knot of complexity of a country which we call Lebanon.

Yet, against all odds, what we behold here is an enriching complexity. A thriving complexity which feeds on mutual acceptance, respect for diversity, continuous fine-tuning.

And I hope that Europe, apart from paying visits and lending a (most needed) hand, will learn what is to be learnt.
