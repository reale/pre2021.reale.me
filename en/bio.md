I describe myself as an Innovation Manager with more than 10 years of experience in e-government projects and digital transformation of critical industries at the national and EU level (parliamentary bodies, public finance, procurement, strategic infrastructures, utilities), and 20 years of experience in ICT engineering and management (including open-source projects).

Since I view large-scale projects as the complex interplay of many different areas, I seek constant involvement in all facets of the digital transformation: technology, financing, organization, security, communication, governance, policymaking, society, environment.

I am a member of standardization bodies at the national and EU level and of several international and Italian associations including IEEE. I also research and teach on the organizational, economical and formal aspects of innovation and digital transformation.

By delivering keynotes in conferences and meetings throughout Europe and by conducting an extensive communication campaign, I strive to be a thought leader on digital transformation and its impact on our society and culture.

As the proud founder of <a href="https://eutopian.eu" target="_blank">Eutopian</a>, a think tank focused on the digital citizenship, I believe in technology as an enabler for democracy.

Currently I live in Rome, Italy.
